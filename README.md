# my-threejs-webxr-drawing

This project is an Anatomy Pictionary. You can play "solo" where you only need your pc to draw and people around can try to guess. You can also "play with friends", but the project isn't hosted somewhere. All you'd have to do is find a host so that everyone can play. However, you can still test this fully functional mode on your own computer.
